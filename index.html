		<h1> Authors: Justin Floyd, Ethan Parks, Walter Hoang </h1>
		<h2> Summary: We tested the click condition first. Walter went first then Justin.
					The average was 4.03 bits/second.
					Then we tested the tap condition where Ethan went first then Walter.
					The average was 1.62 bits/second.
					We concluded that based off of throughput, clicking was better then tapping on a trackpad.
